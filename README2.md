TO DO 

Look at trello board and follow up with everything and build a gameplan.

Going to have to build some sort of little business model so we know what and who were selling too.

Remember this is a niche site targeted at the younger audience, for college students and younger people traveling with friends 

Could make it a collab experience too where you can build a group and everyone plan and add stuff like flights and hotels to a list.
