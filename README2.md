Some thoughts ....

    Need to somehow send the user there reservation to their email and be able to view on app.
    I want the user to be able to look at their itenirary and be able to find flight ticket and hotel confirmation email.
    So that way they dont need to go to 6 different apps and processes just to get on a flight.



Need to figure out the API situation. I need to figure out the approval process or find another way to do this besides travelPayouts

Need to start building pages and adding buttons

DATABASE -

    Going to need a database for users to be able to attatch themselves to their groups and trips.

        PASSWORD
        TRIPS
        GROUPS
        TRIPDETAILS()
